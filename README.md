# Healthcare-Demand-Projection-for-a-Synthetic-Sample-of-England-with-Shinyapp-
The project estimated healthcare demand over 30 years using hypothetical UK data for conditions like hypertension and diabetes in a cohort of 1,000 individuals. In Phase 1, data from CPRD, HES, HSE, and CMS were merged, cleaned, and analyzed using Negative Binomial and linear regression models to assess factors influencing hospital visits. Phase 2 involved microsimulation to generate a synthetic population, simulating healthcare demand while accounting for variables like age, sex, and multimorbidity. Phase 3 projected hospital visits and stays for 2025 and 2054. Healthcare costs were estimated by multiplying hospital stay lengths by a Â£250 per hour rate, applying a discount for future costs. Finally, a Shiny app was developed to visualize the data, allowing users to filter by year and demographic (e.g., sex). The app compares hospital visits, hospital lengths of stay,  generate plots and simulation results for the selected year vs. 2025.
